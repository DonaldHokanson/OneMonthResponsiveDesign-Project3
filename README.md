# One Month Responsive Design - Project #3

This is the third project for the One Month Responsive Design class that I completed using HTML5 and CSS3.

The intention of this project was to create a video talking about what we had learned so far.  Then we were giving a bland starting template and told that we had to incorporate a color pallette, create our own content, and make the website look good at all 3 breakpoints.  I've included a file called "landing-page-template" with the original template so you can compare what I started with to my final product.
